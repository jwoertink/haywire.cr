# haywire.cr

A crystal c-binding around [Haywire](https://github.com/haywire/haywire) used for HTTP server/client

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  haywire:
    github: jwoertink/haywire.cr
```

## Usage

Check out the `examples` directory for a few ideas on how to use this.


## Development

The goal would be to have a 1 to 1 mapping to crystal's built in `HTTP` library. Then being able to switch it out for this (provided this is any better?)
